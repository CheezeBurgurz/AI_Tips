# Known ILLUSION Standards

## Common

### Generic

-   All of game data is serialized to `ResourceManager` MonoBehavior.
    That is perfect entry to find all of assets what game is referencing from.
-   The texture coloring and pattern is rendered with Render Target Texture and shader.

### ADV

-   ADV system is one of the system ILLUSION uses for generic events in the game.
-   It has it's own variable system.

## Honey Select 2
