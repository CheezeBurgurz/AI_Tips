##### Add Scale to measure the map's size.

There is `Character Scale Measurement` prefab that helps you to scale your map into AI-shoujo's size. That cylinder is average character size in AI-shoujo.

Most of map will be fine if you scale 9x times larger than original size. but don't forget to scale it properly.

##### (Optional) Place Lights

Since not most of people are not expert of lights so it's good idea to put some lights and make scene static to make look good for everyone.

You can bake lightmaps and reflection probe, light probes to get extra good quality

##### Make Everything in Layer 11 (Map)
